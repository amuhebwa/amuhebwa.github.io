### Job market alert
I am currently on the job market, open to both academic (Assistant Professorship) and industrial (Applied Research Scientist, Machine Learning Engineer, Data Scientist, and Software Engineer) roles.

### About Me
I am a 5th Ph.D student in Electrical and Computer Engineering at the University of Massachusetts Amherst where I am a member of STIMA Lab and honored to be advised by Prof. jay Taneja.<br>
I am a [UN-IPCC](https://www.ipcc.ch/) scholar, an [e-GUIDE](https://eguide.io/) fellow and part of [DAWG](https://swot.jpl.nasa.gov/documents/4050/) - a consortium of scientists building both physics-based and machine learning algorithms for the upcoming NASA SWOT Mission. <br>
Previously, I completed my masters degree in Electrical and Computer Engineering from Carnegie Mellon University, and a bachelors degree in Computer Engineering from Makerere University.<br>

### Experience
In my previous life, I was water transmission line inspector, a Software Engineer, a Fullstack Engineer, an ML engineer, and Teaching Assistant. If you'd like to know more about my background and education, check out my [LinkedIn profile](https://www.linkedin.com/in/amuhebwa/) or [CV](https://amuhebwa.github.io/muhebwa_CV).<br>

### Research Interests
I leverage machine learning (ML) and satellite data in order to support critical infrastructure (e.g., roads, electricity grid, and water resources) measurement and analysis, sustainable development, and understand the effect of anthropogenic climate change on water resources and the resulting impact on key sectors like clean energy generation, agriculture and transport. My research is interdisciplinary, sitting the nexus of Enviromental Engineering, Civil Engineering, Electrical and Computer Engineering, and Computer Science. <br>
Side note: I am always open to collaborations and working on interesting data-driven problems with significant importance and applicability to the global south.

Some of my ongoing projects include:
- Global River Discharge from Pure Satellite Observations
- Fair and Explainable Machine Learning Models in Hydrology
- Improved Road Quality Prediction from Low Resolution and Sparse Satellite Imagery
