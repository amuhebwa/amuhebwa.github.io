**Job market alert**. *I am currently on the job market, open to both academic (Assistant Professorship) and industrial (Applied Research Scientist, Machine Learning Engineer, Data Scientist, and Software Engineer) roles.*
### About Me
---
I am a 5th Ph.D student in Electrical and Computer Engineering at the **University of Massachusetts Amherst** where I am a member of STIMA Lab and honored to be advised by Prof. Jay Taneja.<br>

I am a [UN-IPCC](https://www.ipcc.ch/) scholar, an [e-GUIDE](https://eguide.io/) fellow and part of [DAWG](https://swot.jpl.nasa.gov/documents/4050/) - a consortium of scientists building both physics-based and machine learning algorithms for the upcoming NASA SWOT Mission. <br>

Previously, I completed my masters degree in Electrical and Computer Engineering from **Carnegie Mellon University**, and a bachelors degree in Computer Engineering from **Makerere University**.<br>

### Research Interests
---
I leverage **machine learning (ML) and satellite data** in order to support critical infrastructure (e.g., roads, electricity grid, and water resources) measurement and analysis, **sustainable development**, and understand the effect of anthropogenic **climate change** on water resources and the resulting impact on key sectors like **clean energy generation, agriculture and transport.** <br>

My research is **interdisciplinary**, sitting at the nexus of Enviromental Engineering, Civil Engineering, Electrical and Computer Engineering, and Computer Science. <br>

For an overview of my published work, see my [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=8mdZdQTo2SYC&hl=en). <br>
**Some of my ongoing projects include**:
- Global River Discharge from Pure Satellite Observations: Can we leverage information from data rich regions (e.g., North America) to improve discharge predictions in data sparse regions (e.g., global south) ?
- Fair and Explainable Machine Learning Models in Hydrology: How trustworthy are machine learning models trained and validate using heterogenous data from different geographic regions ?
- Improved Road Quality Prediction from Low Resolution and Sparse Satellite Imagery (Region of Study: Kenya)

### Experience
---
In my previous life, I was water transmission line inspector, a Software Engineer, a Fullstack Engineer, an ML engineer, and Teaching Assistant.
