# Aggrey M. Muhebwa
I am a fifth year (yes, 5 years) Ph.D student in Electrical and Computer Engineering at the University of Massachusetts Amherst where I am a member of STIMA Lab, and honored to be advised by Prof. jay Taneja. <br>
I am a [UN-IPCC](https://www.ipcc.ch/) scholar, an [e-GUIDE](https://eguide.io/) fellow and part of 
[DAWG](https://swot.jpl.nasa.gov/documents/4050/) - a consortium of scientists building both physics-based and machine learning algorithms for the upcoming NASA SWOT Mission. <br>
I completed my masters degree in Electrical and Computer Engineering from Carnegie Mellon University, and a bachelors degree in Computer Engineering from Makerere University.
