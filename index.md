**Job market alert**. *I am currently on the job market, open to both Applied research scientist and Assistant Professorship roles.*
### About Me
---
I am a second-year **Postdoctoral Researcher in Civil and Environmental Engineering at Stanford University**, where I am privileged to work with Prof. Khalid Osman. I completed my **PhD in Electrical and Computer Engineering at the University of Massachusetts Amherst** where I was a member of STIMA Lab and honored to be advised by Prof. Jay Taneja.<br>

Thanks to the generosity of lots of people (and guidance of my PhD advisor), my PhD was funded through multiple streams: [UN-IPCC](https://www.ipcc.ch/) scholar (2021-2023), [e-GUIDE](https://eguide.io/) fellowship (2018-2023) and part of [DAWG](https://swot.jpl.nasa.gov/documents/4050/) (2019 - Present) - a consortium of scientists building both physics-based and machine learning algorithms for the upcoming NASA SWOT Mission. <br>

Previously, I completed my masters degree in **Electrical and Computer Engineering from Carnegie Mellon University** and a bachelors degree in **Computer Engineering from Makerere University**.<br>

### Research Interests
---
My research focuses on **leveraging AI to address sustainability challenges in climate change, water resources, and large-scale infrastructure systems**. I focus on developing and optimizing AI systems that prioritize environmental sustainability while enabling seamless collaboration and data sharing across diverse regions. Additionally, I am exploring the **potential of LLMs to tackle critical societal issues**, such as generating tailored first aid protocols for pesticide contaminations and uncovering insights from infrastructure assessment reports, among other applications.. <br>

My research is **interdisciplinary**, sitting at the nexus of Environmental Engineering, Civil Engineering, Electrical and Computer Engineering, and Computer Science. <br>
